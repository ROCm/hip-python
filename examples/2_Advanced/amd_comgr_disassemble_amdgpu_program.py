"""How to disassemble AMD GPU programs via AMD COMGR

In this example, we disassemble an AMD GPU program that is written in
machine code. Such a program could, for example, be extracted from the body of
a GPU kernel or device function.

This example was derived from the original C++ AMD COMGR test:
