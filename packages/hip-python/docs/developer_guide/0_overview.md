# Overview and High-Level Build Interfaces

This developer guide chapter shows you how to use the repository's 
high-level build interfaces to generate HIP Python's Cython sources, the final packages,
and the documentation. While this guide does not target the typical HIP Python user, an understanding of
the HIP Python build and packaging process might still be of interest to advanced
users that want to tailor the code generator or the autogenerated source code
to their needs.

## Targeted Audience

### DevOps Engineers

As a DevOps engineer, you will work on the highest level of the HIP Python repository
and in the ``packages`` subfolder. You will mainly be  concerned with the scripts 
``generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh`` for code generation and ``packages/build_hip_python_pkgs.sh``
for package and docs building.

### Developers

As a developer, you will work on the highest level of the HIP Python repository.
You will likely tune the code generation inputs in ``codegen_hip_python.py`` and ``_controls.py``, 
or fix bugs/add features in folder `_codegen`.
For developers, all sections of this guide are likely of interest.

### Advanced Users

Most users will likely not want to get their hands on the code generation infrastructure.
Instead they will download and install prebuilt packages via `pip` or `conda`,
or they download the pregenerated package sources for a specific ROCm&reg; release from the
corresponding branch of the HIP Python git repository.
We refer users interested in the second approach to chapter [Building and Packaging](2_packaging.md) 
If you want to further tailor the code generation 
output according to your needs, then take a look into chapter [Code Generation](1_code_generation.md)
too. If you think your modifications should be made available to other users too and are about
to create a pull request, please first take a look at chapter [Commit Guidelines](4_commit_guide.md).

## Building from Source

Building the HIP Python packages consists can be achieved in two steps:

1. Code generation via `generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh`.
2. Package and docs building via `packages/build_hip_python_pkgs.sh`.

The former script can be used as follows:

```
Usage: ./generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --rocm-path       Path to a ROCm&reg; installation, defaults to variable 'ROCM_PATH' if set or '/opt/rocm'.
  -l, --libs        HIP Python modules to generate as comma separated list without whitespaces, defaults to variable 'HIP_PYTHON_LIBS' if set or '*'.
  --pre-clean       Remove the virtual Python environment subfolder '_venv' --- if it exists --- before all other tasks.
  --post-clean      Remove the virtual Python environment subfolder '_venv' --- if it exists --- after all other tasks.
  -n, --no-venv     Do not create and use a virtual Python environment.
  -h, --help        Show this help message.
```

The latter can be used as shown below:

```
Usage: ./build_hip_python_pkgs.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --rocm-path        Path to a ROCm&reg; installation, defaults to variable 'ROCM_PATH' if set or '/opt/rocm'.
  --no-hip           Do not build package 'hip-python'.
  --no-cuda          Do not build package 'hip-python-as-cuda'.
  --no-docs          Do not build the docs of package 'hip-python'.
  --no-api-docs      Temporarily move the 'hip-python/docs/python_api' subfolder so that sphinx does not see it.
  --no-clean-docs    Do not generate docs from scratch, i.e. don't run sphinx with -E switch.
  -j,--num-jobs      Number of build jobs to use (currently only applied for building docs). Defaults to 1.
  --pre-clean        Remove the virtual Python environment subfolder '_venv' --- if it exists --- before all other tasks.
  --post-clean       Remove the virtual Python environment subfolder '_venv' --- if it exists --- after all other tasks.
  -n, --no-venv      Do not create and use a virtual Python environment.
  -h, --help         Show this help message.
```

By default, both scripts will create a virtual Python environment named `_venv` in their
respective parent folder when run. All Python dependencies are automatically installed 
into these environments.

On systems with an ROCm&reg; installation installed to the standard location, it suffices to run:

```{eval-rst}
.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Code generation and building (no removal of virtual Python environments).
   
   cd hip-python
   ./generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh
   cd packages
   ./build_hip_python_pkgs.sh
```

To remove the virtual environemts after running the script, do add additionally
the `--post-clean` flag as shown below:

```{eval-rst}
.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Code generation and building plus removal of virtual Python environments.
   
   cd hip-python
   ./generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh --post-clean
   cd packages
   ./build_hip_python_pkgs.sh --post-clean
```

### Code Generation Step

In the code generation step, the header files in a ROCm&reg; installation are parsed
and the HIP Python's Cython modules are generated. Moreover, content of
the `hipify-perl` script is combined with the HIP header file parse trees in order to generate
the CUDA interoperability layer. Finally, package metadata and documentation files
per HIP and CUDA interoperability layer module are generated.

The script `./generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh` abstracts all these tasks
plus the dependency management.
The full script is [printed below](generate_hip_python_pkgs_sh) for a deeper inspection.
Most options do not concern DevOps engineers, they are mainly intended for easing
development work.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh
   :linenos:
   :language: bash
   :name: generate_hip_python_pkgs_sh
   :caption: Code generation script (``generate_hip_python_pkgs.sh``).
```

### Packaging and Docs Building Step

In the second step, the generated Cython modules are compiled to Python modules before
both are packaged via PyPA `~.build` into a `~.pip` wheel that can be 
installed directly or uploaded to a package repository such as PyPI.
Finally, the docs are built in this step which require the previously build packages as dependencies.

The script `./packages/build_hip_python_pkgs.sh` abstracts all these tasks 
plus the dependency management --- aside from uploading the package.
The full script is [printed below](build_hip_python_pkgs_sh) for a deeper inspection.
Most options do not concern DevOps engineers, they are mainly intended for easing
development work.
